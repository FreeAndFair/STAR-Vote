-- system components {{{
controller
epollbook
	look up status, record status, find precinct + ballot style, print sticker with precinct and ballot style
voting terminal
paper ballot review station
physical ballot box
provisional ballot box
bulletin board
TPM
polling location network
	perhaps best BON'd as a cluster pointing at the components that are on the network
-- TODO: is there (or shall we name) a component responsible for the tallying
-- process?
-- }}}
-- data munged by the system {{{
-- properties/adjectives {{{
active vs inactive
	possible states of voting codes
empty vs full
	describes ballots in various stages of the voting process
well-formed vs ill-formed
	whether a ballot has overvotes/undervotes and matches its ballot style
-- }}}
voter status
	registered, checked in, provisional
casting status
	unknown, cast, spoiled
ballot style
voting code
	5-digit code used to "identify" a voter/session inside the polling location network
ballot serial number
	== ballot casting ID, I think?
voting terminal ID
verifiable voting commitment
	maybe should be called "verifiable ballot commitment"
	hash code of the encrypted ballot contents
encrypted ballot
cryptographic key
trustee private key
election public key
selections
NIZK proof
signature key
digital signature
vote
	cast ballot
electronic ballot
encrypted tally
ballot summary
	listing of selections for each race
	shown by voting terminal before producing physical ballot
internal hash chain
public hash chain
	maybe not needed, since it's not used anywhere?
ballot ID
ballot casting ID
hash chain link
-- }}}
-- physical artifacts munged by the system {{{
pollbook sticker
voting code slip
physical pollbook
paper ballot
voting receipt
	maybe should be called "committed ballot receipt"
verifiable decryption
-- }}}
-- actions taken by participants in the system {{{
-- TODO: perhaps this should be fleshed out by walking through the whole
-- election process and naming every stage/thing that gets done by any party
cast
spoil
risk-limiting audit
hash
encrypt
shuffle
-- added not from text of the paper but by walking through the election process
-- in my head:
generate election keys
generate signature keys
initialize internal hash chain
initialize public hash chain
populate epollbook
register
fill out ballot
publish voting record
verify vote inclusion
verify encrypted vote tally
decrypt vote tally
verify plaintext vote tally
-- }}}
-- ideas that incidentally need to be defined, but aren't really core to the guarantees/properties/implementation of the system {{{
voter
polling location
precinct
poll worker
provisional voter
time
date
election trustee
race
write-in candidate
undervote
-- }}}
threshold
	...of election trustees needed to finalize an election
election outcome evidence
write-in slot

-- requirements I had forgotten about {{{
battery life
long ballots
physical ballot box must reject provisional ballots
privilege separation
auditory interface
voter-supplied hardware support
pretty much all of section 4.2
ballots must be automatically spoiled after a bit
no data shared between receipt and paper ballot
